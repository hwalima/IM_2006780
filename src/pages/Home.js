        This website project is an attempt to bring a nostalgic experience by
        collecting various retro internet and digital artifacts and experiences into
        the contemporary space. <b /> <b /> While retro digital media users often acted as
        private collectors of digital artifacts, contemporary technology culture is
        fast favoring a constant exchange, storage, discussion, and manipulation
        of information about digital artifacts past and present. This website pursues to
        showcase how such a collection and curation space could exist.

        (Ordonneau, 2019) argues that the consequences of new media and their
        manifestations in post-digital arts have deeply modified electronic
        curation, a concept that is still being built as a parallel structure to
        the prestigious walls and corridors called museums. The consumption of
        retro artifacts like a new game console, the first booting of Windows
        95, or the first browsing experience of Netscape was associated with
        “who has it, or who got it first attitude”, and excitement associated
        with scarcity.

        A web user born in the year 2000 would not understand what was exciting
        about these fossil artifacts. I was inspired by a site called “old web
        today” that takes you back to the days of dial-up internet while using
        some of the web’s earliest browsers, like Mosaic, Netscape Navigator,
        and Internet Explorer 3.0.{" "}

        In his book Game -After a cultural study, Guins (2014) Guins summons us
        to a train of thought where well-lived memories of arcade gaming and
        gaming art are catapulted to the digital ecospheres, more often without
        the documentation of what is lost in the translation. As I capture
        snippets of some of the retro digital artifacts, I seek to provoke the
        user into the imagination of what might have been lost in memory. What
        is still known about the artists?

        This project intends to experiment on the nostalgia created when old and
        new artifacts blend into each other to create a new aesthetic while
        capturing the digital experience before the dawn of the new millennium.
        I want this to be a cut and paste curation of -retro digital media
        aesthetic. When a user of this website views the Windows 95 for example,
        there is a tendency to mentally compare the snippet of the 1995 based
        operating system to what they might know better: (a Windows 10 dominated
        computing world)
